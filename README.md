The main goal of the project is to develop a language-knowledge database for natural language processing.
An ideal result is a graph, that would be helpful in a word-sense disambiguation. WordNet, RuWordNed, and FrameNet are proposed to be used.
Project steps:
1. Converting WordNet into a graph representation.
2* Importing FrameNet.
3* Providing access for dictionaries.
4* Populating original graph with relations from the Text<=>Meaning Theory.
5* Importing RuWordNet.
6* Providing English-Russian support.
